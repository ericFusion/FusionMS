      <h1>Managed Print Services (MPS)</h1>
    <p>Our MPS program is a comprehensive service that can manage all aspects of your company's print environment.
    We focus on reducing print costs so clients can focus on their   core business. </p>
    <p>Information Technology Professionals are most productive   when they   spend their time on &quot;higher-performing&quot; activities such as the     organization's computing environment. Print problems are distractions   that take   IT professionals away from their main responsibilities. Our   software reporting and service engineers enhance IT departments   and allow them   to concentrate on more critical responsibilities.</p>
    <h2>Three-Phase Approach to Managed Print Services</h2>
<p>We have developed a proven methodology for helping clients reduce print costs throughout their office environments.<br />
<br />
<strong>Phase 1</strong>: <strong>Control the Current Fleet.</strong> Unlike many copier companies who recommend a strategy of &ldquo;rip and   replace,&rdquo; we work with our client&rsquo;s current environment to assess and take   advantage of instant cost reduction opportunities.<br />
<br />
<strong>Phase 2</strong>: <strong>Optimize the Fleet.</strong> This   is where we help &ldquo;right size&rdquo; and make recommendations for improvements   in the printing environment. Old and malfunctioning printers are retired   and replaced with more cost-efficient models if necessary.<br />
<br />
<strong>Phase 3</strong>: <strong>Enhance the Environment.</strong> In the final phase of the MPS solution, we and the client work together   to look for opportunities that will actually reduce printing in the   client&rsquo;s environment. Disciplines such as document workflow management   and business processes are examined.</p>
<p>Our consultants will show you ways to get the lowest cost per page   without having to purchase any expensive new machines or lock your   company into multi-year contracts.</p>
